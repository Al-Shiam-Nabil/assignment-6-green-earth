#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

  ** Answer: ** Var, let, and const are keywords used for declaring variables. But these keywords have some differences.

  ** Var: ** var is function-scoped, not block-scoped.It can be redeclared and updated.If you declare a var variable inside a function, you cannot access it outside that function.var is hoisted. This means if you use it before declaration, its value will be undefined.

  ** let: ** let is block-scoped.It was introduced in ES6.Its value can be updated, but it cannot be redeclared in the same scope.let is also hoisted, but it is in the Temporal Dead Zone, which means you cannot access it before initialization.

  ** const: ** const is also block-scoped.It was introduced in ES6.Its value cannot be updated and it cannot be redeclared.Like let, const is hoisted but remains in the Temporal Dead Zone, so you cannot access it before initialization.
